Student Performance Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 1,000+ student records to identify trends in exam performance based on factors such as gender, parental education, and test preparation. The analysis was conducted using SQL queries in MySQL.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **"Students' Performance in Exams"** dataset from Kaggle. It includes the following columns:
- `gender`
- `parental_education`
- `test_preparation_course`
- `math_score`
- `reading_score`
- `writing_score`
[Download the dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams).

## Key Findings
- Gender Differences: Female students scored higher on average in reading and writing, while male students scored higher in math.
- Test Preparation: Students who completed the test preparation course scored significantly higher across all subjects.
- Parental Education: Students with higher levels of parental education (e.g., master's degree) performed better on average.
